 * Default dispatch middleware.
 *
 * Checks for a composed route result in the request. If none is provided,
 * delegates to the next middleware.
 *
 * Otherwise, it pulls the middleware from the route result. If the middleware
 * is not http-interop middleware, it uses the composed router, response
 * prototype, and container to prepare it, via the
 * `MarshalMiddlewareTrait::prepareMiddleware()` method. In each case, it then
 * processes the middleware.
 *
 * @deprecated since 2.2.0. This class is now a part of mezzio-router,
